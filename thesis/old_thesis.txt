ABSTRACT

Skin diseases are among the most prevalent and underdiagnosed conditions globally, especially in rural and underserved regions. Traditional methods of consulting dermatologists are limited by access, cost, and delays, leading to mismanagement and worsened health outcomes. This project proposes the development of "Skin Disease Finder," a deep learning-based mobile application that enables users to perform preliminary skin disease identification using their smartphones. Built using Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, TensorFlow Lite for on-device machine learning inference, and Firebase for backend services including authentication and cloud storage, the application aims to provide accessible, immediate, and offline skin disease detection capabilities. The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify multiple types of skin diseases. The application features user registration, image capture or upload options, immediate diagnosis suggestions with confidence scores, comprehensive disease information including symptoms, causes, and treatments, and offline support for diagnosis using a locally embedded TensorFlow Lite model. The anticipated outcomes include improved accessibility to preliminary skin disease screening, increased awareness about dermatological conditions, reduced unnecessary clinical visits, and facilitation of early detection, demonstrating how artificial intelligence and mobile technology can transform healthcare accessibility by bringing medical diagnostic capabilities directly to users' smartphones, especially in areas where dermatological services are unavailable or unaffordable.

INTRODUCTION


1.1 Background
In today's fast-paced healthcare landscape, skin diseases are among the most prevalent and underdiagnosed conditions, especially in rural and underserved regions. Dermatological disorders can vary widely, from mild irritations to serious infections or signs of systemic disease. However, lack of timely diagnosis often leads to mismanagement and worsened health outcomes. Traditional methods of consulting dermatologists are limited by access, cost, and delays. Many people hesitate to visit a doctor until symptoms become severe, and those living in remote areas often lack access to professional dermatological services. The growing prevalence of smartphones and advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have created unprecedented opportunities to bring medical diagnostic capabilities directly to users' devices.
Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning, has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image analysis, including dermatology. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown exceptional performance in classifying skin lesions, with some studies reporting accuracy levels comparable to or exceeding those of board-certified dermatologists [1]. Mobile health (mHealth) applications leveraging AI have the potential to democratize access to preliminary medical screening, enabling users to perform initial assessments from the comfort of their homes [2]. The integration of on-device machine learning models, such as TensorFlow Lite, allows for real-time inference without requiring constant internet connectivity, making these applications practical for use in various settings [3].
However, while several research projects and commercial applications have explored AI-based skin cancer detection, many existing solutions face limitations such as requiring cloud connectivity, limited classification capabilities, or lack of comprehensive user support features. Additionally, most applications focus solely on detection without providing educational resources, test history tracking, or integration with healthcare provider networks. The need for a comprehensive, accessible, and user-friendly mobile application that combines accurate AI-powered detection with supportive features remains significant.
This project introduces "Skin Disease Finder," a deep learning-based mobile application developed using Flutter that enables users to perform preliminary skin disease identification using their smartphones. The application utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify multiple types of skin diseases. Built using Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference, and Firebase for backend services, the system demonstrates how emerging AI technologies can be effectively applied in mobile healthcare to improve accessibility, reduce dermatological burdens, and facilitate early detection, especially in areas where dermatological services are unavailable or unaffordable.
Through this project, we aim to contribute a practical solution that blends AI, mobile technology, and healthcare to create a more accessible, user-friendly, and comprehensive tool for preliminary skin cancer screening, potentially helping users identify concerning skin lesions earlier and seek appropriate medical attention when needed.

1.4.4 Resource and Dataset Constraints
i.	Development is constrained by available computational resources, which may limit model optimization and fine-tuning capabilities.
ii.	The project timeline limits the scope of extensive user testing, clinical validation, and iterative refinement of the AI model.
iii.	The model utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model rather than training a custom model from scratch, which may limit optimization for specific use cases or populations.



CHAPTER 2



RELATED WORK


2.1 Introduction
The integration of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis, particularly in dermatology, has evolved significantly with most research focusing on desktop and cloud-based systems rather than mobile implementations. This section examines relevant literature on AI-driven medical image analysis, mobile health applications, and on-device machine learning, with particular emphasis on skin lesion classification and accessibility.
Recent studies demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of deep learning methods for skin lesion classification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown exceptional performance, with some research reporting that AI systems can achieve accuracy levels comparable to or exceeding those of board-certified dermatologists [5]. These systems leverage large datasets of dermoscopic images to learn distinguishing features of various skin conditions, enabling automated preliminary screening capabilities.
Mobile health (mHealth) applications have become increasingly important tools for healthcare delivery, particularly in underserved and remote areas [6]. These applications leverage the ubiquity of smartphones to bring medical services directly to users, reducing barriers to healthcare access. Studies have shown that mHealth applications can significantly improve healthcare outcomes by enabling early detection, increasing patient engagement, and facilitating continuity of care [7].
On-device machine learning, particularly through frameworks like TensorFlow Lite, has emerged as a critical technology for mobile healthcare applications [8]. By performing inference directly on the device, these systems ensure user privacy, enable offline functionality, and reduce latency compared to cloud-based solutions. This approach is particularly important for medical applications where data privacy and real-time performance are crucial considerations.
However, this project addresses a critical gap in current mobile healthcare applications: the integration of accurate AI-powered skin lesion classification with comprehensive user support features. Unlike standalone diagnostic tools, comprehensive healthcare applications must combine accurate detection with educational resources, history tracking, and integration with healthcare provider networks. The mobile-first approach presents unique challenges including limited computational resources, varying image quality, and the need for intuitive user interfaces that can be used by individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.
The mobile healthcare model presents unique implementation challenges and opportunities. AI models must achieve high accuracy despite device constraints, while applications require comprehensive features that support users throughout their healthcare journey, from initial screening to professional consultation. 
2.2 Existing Systems
The modern healthcare technology landscape demonstrates widespread use of AI and mobile applications to improve diagnostic capabilities and healthcare accessibility. The following system components have inspired various aspects of the proposed project:
2.2.1 AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis Applications
Leading medical AI systems, such as those developed for radiology and pathology, use deep learning algorithms to analyze medical images and assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis. These systems leverage convolutional neural networks trained on large datasets of medical images to identify patterns and anomalies. Our system adopts similar deep learning techniques, utilizing a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to classify skin lesions. By processing user-uploaded images directly on the device, the system provides immediate preliminary screening while maintaining user privacy and enabling offline functionality.

Research projects such as the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) challenge have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models for skin lesion classification. These systems have achieved accuracy levels comparable to dermatologists in controlled studies [10]. Our project leverages similar deep learning architectures, adapted for mobile deployment through TensorFlow Lite, to provide accessible skin lesion classification capabilities.
2.2.4 TensorFlow Lite in Mobile Healthcare
TensorFlow Lite has been successfully deployed in various mobile healthcare applications, enabling on-device machine learning inference for tasks ranging from activity recognition to medical image analysis. This framework allows models to run efficiently on mobile devices with limited computational resources, making AI-powered healthcare accessible to a broader user base. Our application utilizes TensorFlow Lite to perform skin lesion classification directly on users' devices, ensuring privacy and enabling offline functionality.

Telemedicine platforms have revolutionized healthcare delivery by enabling remote consultations and diagnosis. These systems combine video conferencing, image sharing, and electronic health records to facilitate remote healthcare delivery. Our application complements these systems by providing preliminary screening capabilities that can inform telemedicine consultations, enabling more efficient use of healthcare resources and improving access to dermatological care.
2.2.6 Medical Image Processing on Mobile Devices
Various mobile applications have successfully implemented medical image processing capabilities, from simple measurement tools to complex diagnostic aids. These applications demonstrate the feasibility of performing sophisticated image analysis on mobile devices. Our project extends these capabilities by integrating deep learning-based classification, enabling users to receive preliminary diagnostic information directly from their smartphones.
2.3 Critical Remarks
Despite significant developments in AI-powered medical diagnosis and mobile health applications, current systems and literature often overlook several key aspects particularly relevant to accessible, comprehensive mobile healthcare implementations. The proposed system aims to address these gaps:
2.3.1 Limited Accessibility of Medical Diagnosis Tools
Many existing AI-powered medical diagnosis systems are designed for clinical use or require cloud connectivity, limiting their accessibility to users in remote areas or those with limited internet access. Additionally, most systems focus solely on detection without providing comprehensive user support features. Our project addresses this gap by combining on-device AI-powered classification with comprehensive features including disease information, test history tracking, and healthcare provider location services. This integration creates a more accessible and supportive user experience, particularly important for preliminary screening applications where user education and follow-up care are crucial.
2.3.2 Need for On-Device Processing Capabilities

CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION
8.1 Conclusion
This project presented the design and implementation of the Skin Disease Finder, a comprehensive mobile application for preliminary skin disease diagnosis with a focus on integrating deep learning-based features to improve healthcare accessibility. The platform was developed using Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, TensorFlow Lite for on-device machine learning inference using a trained CNN model, and Firebase for backend services including authentication, database, and cloud storage.
The system addresses several critical limitations commonly found in traditional dermatological care, such as limited accessibility, time-consuming appointment scheduling, and lack of preliminary screening tools. By combining on-device AI-powered skin lesion classification with comprehensive user support features including disease information, test history tracking, and healthcare provider location services, the platform offers a more accessible, informative, and user-centric approach to preliminary skin cancer screening.
Key accomplishments of this project include the development of a fully functional mobile healthcare application that enables users to perform preliminary skin disease identification using their smartphones. The system features a deep learning-based classification engine using a trained CNN model that delivers real-time analysis of skin diseases with confidence scores, enhancing user awareness and facilitating early detection. Comprehensive disease information modules are integrated to help users understand their results and make informed decisions. The platform also includes secure test history tracking using Firebase Firestore, allowing users to monitor changes in skin lesions over time. Additionally, healthcare provider location services enable seamless transition from preliminary screening to professional medical consultation. Secure and validated user workflows have been implemented, with Firebase Authentication ensuring proper authorization and data protection for sensitive medical information.
The testing phase confirmed that the system met both functional and non-functional requirements. User interactions, image processing, AI inference, history management, and mapping features performed reliably under expected conditions. The on-device AI model provided consistent classification results, and the Firebase backend services ensured reliable data storage and retrieval.
8.2 Recommendations
While the platform meets its current objectives, there are several areas where enhancements can be made for future development and scalability:
8.2.1 Enhanced AI Models
To further improve the effectiveness of the system, training or fine-tuning the CNN model on larger, more diverse datasets can significantly boost classification accuracy. Incorporating transfer learning techniques, data augmentation, and ensemble methods could improve performance across different skin types, lighting conditions, and image qualities. Expanding the training dataset to include more disease categories and regional variations would enhance the model's diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, implementing model versioning and A/B testing capabilities would allow for continuous improvement of the classification accuracy. Integration with federated learning approaches could enable model improvement while maintaining user privacy. These improvements would contribute to a more accurate, reliable, and clinically useful preliminary screening tool.
8.2.2 Enhanced Mobile Features
Further enhancements to the Flutter mobile application could include advanced features such as improved image preprocessing algorithms to enhance image quality before classification, integration with device-specific camera features for better image capture, support for multiple languages to increase accessibility, and integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems for seamless data sharing with healthcare providers. Additionally, implementing advanced caching strategies, optimizing app performance for lower-end devices, and adding offline data synchronization capabilities would improve accessibility and user experience across a wider range of mobile devices and network conditions. Integration with wearable devices for continuous skin monitoring could represent a significant advancement in preventive healthcare.
