# Skin Cancer Detection App

This is an old project I worked on, where I focused on making it functional and ready to run for a client. The goal of the app was to assist in the detection of skin cancer through advanced algorithms and machine learning models. My primary objective was to ensure the app was robust, user-friendly, and suitable for deployment.

## Project Overview

The Skin Cancer Detection App uses a machine learning model trained to identify skin cancer from images of skin lesions. This app allows users to upload an image of their skin condition and receive a prediction about the likelihood of it being cancerous.

## Key Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of their skin condition.
- **Prediction Results**: The app processes the image and provides a prediction based on the trained model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed to be simple and intuitive for users of all technical backgrounds.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For running machine learning models on mobile devices.
- **Firebase**: For backend services such as authentication and cloud storage (if applicable).

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/5aeedkhan/skin_cancer_detection_app.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd skin_cancer_detection_app
Install dependencies:


flutter pub get
Run the app:


flutter run
Future Enhancements
Improved Model: Implement a more accurate model using additional data.

User Profiles: Add user profiles for saving history and predictions.

Better UI: Enhance the user interface for a more polished experience.
